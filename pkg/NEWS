chemosensors 0.7.8
==================

* This version was submitted to CRAN #2. 
  The `multicore` package was depreciated according to the updated CRAN policies.
  
chemosensors 0.7.7
==================

* This version was submitted to CRAN. The only change from version 0.7.6 is that 
  the documentation has been updated to meet the CRAN policies.

chemosensors 0.7.6
==================

* This version was used to perform calculations for the article #2.

chemosensors 0.7.5
==================

* Parameter `snf` for SensorNoiseModel has changed its default value
  from `c(1, 1, 0.2)` to `c(1, 1, 1)`.
* Method `predict` for class `SensorNoiseModel` has been corrected.
  
chemosensors 0.7.4
==================

* Most of plot method have been rewritten in a ggplot2 manner.
* Fixed the demo `SensorAffinity`, particularly, the set of gas classes must 
  contain more gas classes.
* Class `Scenario` rewritten. Not the class object doesn't store a data.frame 
  of concentration matrix. That means slot `df` is depreciated. Instead, method
  `sdata.frame` constructs the data.frame based on new slots `T`, `nT`, `V` and `nV`.

chemosensors 0.7.3
==================
* Added CITATION file.

chemosensors 0.7.1
==================

* Reorganized the way the package loads the datasets. Now DESCRIPTION file has line 
  `LazyData: yes`.
* All the datasets are unified the the list structure. That means you get a list 
  `UNIMANdistr` by loading dataset `UNIMANdistr.RData` by command `data(UNIMANdistr)`.
  Updated datasets: `UNIMANdnoise.RData`, `UNIMANsorption.RData`, `UNIMANshort.RData`,
  `UNIMANsnoise.RData` and `UNIMANtransient.RData`.

chemosensors 0.6.1
==================

* The internal development of the packaged is organized in the 'devtools' stype.

chemosensors 0.5.5
==================

* Added two new data models in 'SensorDataModel' class: 'broken-stick' and 'ispline'.
* The default data model is set to 'ispline'.
* The default value of 'Knonlin' parameter is set to 0.7 (adjusted for AC binary mixtures).
* Function 'getISplineDesign' is replaced by 'getIQSplineDesign' (with a custom 
  formula) when the spline basis functions are quadratic. Speed up by factor 2.

chemosensors 0.5.4
==================

* Updated dataset 'UNIMANdnoise'; components in variable 'dspace' are ordered
  according to the importance values in variable 'ndvar'.
* Updated documentation for all classes; added documentation for datasets.
* Added datasets 'UNIMANtransient'.
* Introduced method 'affinity' to compute the affinity charcacteristic of sensors.
* Added a new demo VirtualSensors.

chemosensors 0.5.3
==================

* Added the file NAMESPACE.
* Added the classes 'DriftCommonModel' and 'DriftNoiseModel'.
  The latter class is a sub-class of the class 'SensorArray'.

chemosensors 0.5.2
==================

* Initial import includes basic classes, two demos, tests.
