chemosensors 0.5.5
==================

* Added two new data models in 'SensorDataModel' class: 'broken-stick' and 'ispline'.
* The default data model is set to 'ispline'.
* The default value of 'Knonlin' parameter is set to 0.7 (adjusted for AC binary mixtures).
* Function 'getISplineDesign' is replaced by 'getIQSplineDesign' (with a custom 
  formula) when the spline basis functions are quadratic. Speed up by factor 2.

chemosensors 0.5.4
==================

* Updated dataset 'UNIMANdnoise'; components in variable 'dspace' are ordered
  according to the importance values in variable 'ndvar'.
* Updated documentation for all classes; added documentation for datasets.
* Added datasets 'UNIMANtransient'.
* Introduced method 'affinity' to compute the affinity charcacteristic of sensors.
* Added a new demo VirtualSensors.

chemosensors 0.5.3
==================

* Added the file NAMESPACE.
* Added the classes 'DriftCommonModel' and 'DriftNoiseModel'.
  The latter class is a sub-class of the class 'SensorArray'.

chemosensors 0.5.2
==================

* Initial import includes basic classes, two demos, tests.
